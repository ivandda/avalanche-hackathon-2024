# Educational Funding System MVP Plan

## Core Functionalities

1. Government Asset Pool
2. Digital Vouchers
3. University Payment System
4. Simplified Student Performance Tracking
5. Basic User Interface

## Technology Stack

### Blockchain Layer
- **Avalanche L1**: Deploy a custom L1 chain for the educational funding system
  - Use AvaCloud for no-code deployment
  - Benefit: Tailored blockchain for educational purposes with high scalability

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity**: Implement core logic for vouchers, payments, and performance tracking
  - Deploy on the custom Avalanche L1

### Cross-Chain Communication
- **Teleporter**: Enable communication between Avalanche Fuji testnet and custom L1
  - Use case: Transfer voucher data or payment information between chains

### Oracle Integration
- **Chainlink Functions**: Integrate with external systems for data verification
  - Use case: Verify student enrollment status or university accreditation

### Data Indexing and Visualization
- **Glacier & Webhooks**: Create dashboards for stakeholders
  - Use case: Display real-time funding statistics and student performance metrics

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14**: Develop user interfaces for students, universities, and government officials

## MVP Components Breakdown

1. **Government Asset Pool**
   - Smart contract on Avalanche L1 to manage funds
   - Functions: deposit, withdraw, check balance
   - Chainlink integration: Use Chainlink Functions to verify government fund transfers

2. **Digital Vouchers**
   - Implement as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Avalanche L1
   - Metadata: value, expiration, basic performance criteria
   - Minting function for government use

3. **University Payment System**
   - Smart contract for universities to accept voucher payments
   - Function for universities to redeem credits for funds
   - Use Teleporter to communicate payment info between Fuji and custom L1

4. **Simplified Student Performance Tracking**
   - Basic smart contract for universities to update student status
   - Simple pass/fail criteria based on predefined thresholds

5. **User Interface (Next.js 14)**
   - Student dashboard: View voucher status, make payments
   - University dashboard: Accept payments, update student status
   - Government dashboard: Mint vouchers, manage asset pool

6. **Data Visualization (Glacier & Webhooks)**
   - Create a dashboard displaying:
     - Total funds in asset pool
     - Number of active vouchers
     - University payment statistics
     - Basic student performance metrics

## Implementation Strategy

1. Set up custom Avalanche L1 using AvaCloud
2. Develop and deploy core smart contracts on the L1
3. Integrate Chainlink Functions for external data verification
4. Implement Teleporter for cross-chain communication with Fuji testnet
5. Create data indexing solution using Glacier
6. Develop user interfaces with Next.js 14
7. Set up visualization dashboards using Glacier & Webhooks

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Implement more complex performance tracking
- Enhance cross-chain functionality for multi-university ecosystems
- Develop advanced analytics using Chainlink's data streams
- Explore custom VM or HyperSDK integration for specialized educational computations
