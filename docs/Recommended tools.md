1. Benefits of using a custom Layer 1 over mainnet for your project: a) Customization: A custom L1 allows you to tailor the blockchain specifically for educational funding. You can optimize parameters like block time, gas fees, and consensus mechanisms to suit your specific needs. b) Scalability: Your own L1 can handle a high volume of transactions without competing for resources on the mainnet. This is crucial for a nationwide educational system that might process millions of transactions. c) Cost-effectiveness: Operating on your own L1 can significantly reduce transaction costs compared to using the mainnet, making it more feasible for frequent, small-value transactions like regular student attendance updates. d) Governance: You can implement specialized governance mechanisms for educational stakeholders, allowing for more direct control over protocol upgrades and policy changes. e) Privacy: While still maintaining transparency, a custom L1 allows for more control over what data is public vs. private, which is important when dealing with student information.
2. The need for Teleporter in your project: Teleporter is Avalanche's cross-chain communication protocol. In your project, it's beneficial for several reasons: a) Interoperability: It allows your educational funding system to interact with other Avalanche subnets or the mainnet. For example, you might want to keep the main educational data on your custom L1, but allow for fund transfers from the mainnet. b) Scalability: You can use Teleporter to offload certain computations or storage to other chains, helping your main educational chain remain performant. c) Future-proofing: As your system grows, you might want to interact with other educational systems or financial services on different chains. Teleporter provides this capability. d) Demonstration of Avalanche's capabilities: Using Teleporter showcases your project's ability to leverage Avalanche's full tech stack, which is important for the hackathon.
3. Stakeholders and benefits of using Glacier: In your project, the main stakeholders are:
    - Students
    - Universities
    - Government officials/agenciesGlacier is Avalanche's data indexing solution. Its benefits for your project include: a) Real-time data: Glacier allows you to index and query blockchain data in real-time, enabling up-to-date dashboards for all stakeholders. b) Custom queries: You can create specific queries to extract relevant data for each stakeholder group. c) Data visualization: Glacier integrates well with visualization tools, allowing you to create intuitive dashboards. d) Performance: It's optimized for Avalanche, ensuring fast data retrieval without putting extra load on your blockchain.
